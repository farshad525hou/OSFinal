The objective of this program is to user client server model to communicate
between computers on the anaconda network at UML. This program allows a client to
send a message to a server, causing the server to preform an action based on the
message.

This program contains to C source files client.c and server.c
To compile simply use the makefile by typing make into terminal.
NOTE: The server host is currently set to anaconda3, so the server must be run
on that machine. This can be changed in the code. The client may run on any machine
on the anaconda network.
